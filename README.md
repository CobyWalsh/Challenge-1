## Week 1 Code Refactor
I was given an pre-made HTML and CSS code to refractor this week. In the HTML code I changed all the div elements to thier proper elements. These inluded elements such as header, footer, main, nav and section elements. I also added a content element explaining what Horiseion provides, as well as changing the title to Horiseion. I made sure all the clickable links were working properly and took you to the correct location on the webpage. I also added alts to all the images, to explain what the images are and for people who may be using the website with disabilities or if the image fails to appear. I made sure the HTML and CSS is organized and follows a semantic structure and I provided comments to the CSS code explaining what the code is performing. Lastly I deployed the application so it is live on the web.
